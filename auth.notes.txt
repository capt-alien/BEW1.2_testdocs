I. Day 5: Documentation via Docsify



Documentation: Things we do don't exist unless it is written


**Strategy**
1) Document feature first
2) review documentation with users/stakeholders before any development begins
3) Once written  commence development
4) Unit tests should be written that test the features as described by the documentation.
5) When a feature is being modified, it should be modified documentation-first.
6) When docs are modified, tests are modified. No exceptions.
7)Documentation and software should both be versioned:


Order of Operations
 1.Write docs
 2.Get feedback
 3.TDD (tests fully align with documentation)
 4.Push features live
 5.Test live functionality
 6.Publish documentation
 7.Increment versions
 8.Deliver feature to users



 docsify
 A magical documentation site generator.

 What it is
 docsify generates your documentation website on the fly. Unlike GitBook, it does not generate static html files. Instead, it smartly loads and parses your Markdown files and displays them as a website. To start using it, all you need to do is create an index.html and deploy it on GitHub Pages.

 See the Quick start guide for more details.
